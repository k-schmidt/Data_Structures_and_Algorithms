# Derivative as Slope of a Tangent Line

Take two points on the line, `a = (a, f(a))` and `b = (b, f(b))`.

## Slope Formula
**Slope** `= rise/run = (change in y)/(change in x)

## Calculation
`(change in y) = (f(b) - f(a)) / (b - a)`

## Slope of a Curve
Find the slope at some point on the curve.
The slope of the curve changes at every point. Therefore, the point you choose on the curve matters in order to calculate the slope at that point.


Find the slope of `x^2` at point `(x, f(x))`, `(x + h, f(x + h))`?
```
slope of secant line = (f(x+h) - f(x)) / ((x+h) - (x)) = (f(x + h) - f(x)) / h
take the limit as h -> 0 is the derivative of f
```
