# Behavioral Notes
2017-03-05

+ The people who succeed are normal people who worked hard.
+ People who succeed _love_ solving problems.
+ Strongly believe in themselves.
    + Never give up
        + Don't talk yourself out of it.
        + If you don't believe in yourself **you will fail**
        + Do **not** hope.
    + How badly do you want it?
+ Very well prepared with technical stuff.
+ How you sell yourself matters.
+ You have to deliver at a higher level of performance than your daily life.
+ Practice is the only thing in your hands.
+ Go to the interview to solve fun problems.
    + **NOT** to get a job
+ It is **not** about IQ, college, CS degree, or pedigree.
+ They really really really really want success. **REGARDLESS** of how long it takes.
+ They are willing to work hard, defiantly. Nothing bogs them down.
+ There is unyielding, respectful confidence.


In the very first phone call with a recruiter, ask what the interview process is like.


Assume that the person is there to help you.


## Deliberate Practice


1. Specific curriculum
2. Specific method
3. Specific feedback
4. Repitition
    5. Does not happen often enough


**Skipping the phone interview doubles your chances.**


## Making the Best of Your Time in the Course

0. Understand the opportunity
    + Very skewed supply/demand these days
        +. Take advantage of this opportunity
    + Excellent salaries: at par running a small-business
    + Companies **WANT** you to prepare.
1. Make a System
    + Having a goal is necessary but not sufficient
    + Practice everyday (deliberately)
    + System is **FAR** more important than goals
        + Make and Stick to a System, one topic a week
        + *When* are you going to work on this?
        + *Not* necessarily a schedule
            + e.g. 2 hours a day of a specific type of problem, 2 hours a day of another type of problem
    + Identify companies to interview in tiers.
        + Easy companies - if you haven't interviewed in a while
        + Practice companies - similar interviews to your favorite ones
        + Favorite companies - when you are at your FU limits
    + Set a target month and take one or two weeks off from work at that time (4 months)
        + Bunch onsite interviews of favorite companies together
2. Enjoy the Prep
    + Tech moves fast and your're a *career* software engineer.
        + You will have to remain interview-prepared.
        + You can only do that if you enjoy problem-solving
    + Prepare not because you want a job, but because you enjoy CS problems.
    + Solve coding problems because you love solving them.
    + Write code because you have an irresistible urge to code.
    + Explain your solution because you enjoy explaining.
    + Enjoying the Prep and the Problems are **BY FAR** the most important.
3. Make a Commitment
    + "Even if I fail, it should not be because of a lack of prep"
    + Either you succeed, or admit that this is not for you.
4. Actively Participate
    + Take notes in the class, to retain better.
    + Ask questions. Don't feel shy to expose your ignorance.
    + Volunteer to write solutions when called for.
    + **DO NOT RELY ON VIDEOS** for your homework
    + Make *more* than what you'd do from reading a book or listening to an online course.
5. Complete Homework
    + Make time for it
    + In two parts
        + Complete first part, take the test
        + Complete 2nd part, take the mock interview


### How to do Homework Problems?


1. Struggle with the solution **on your own**
    2. Use 90 minutes as a barrier. If you don't find a solution within two 90 minute solutions then look it up.
    3. The **failure** is important and **positive**
    4. Helps to push you out of your comfort zone
        5. Typical interview problems will do this
2. **Before** coding, read correct solution(s)
3. Code only the **most efficient** solution
4. Go back and **compare** your code
5. **Write down what you learned**
    6. **KEEP A JOURNAL!**
        7. Like Flashcards
            8. Problem Statement
                9. How are you going to visually remember the solution to this problem?
                10. **DO NOT** write the code solution on the back of the card, only the description of the solution.


### Struggle


+ Struggle positively, but not indefinitely
+ If you can't solve a problem in TWO sittings of 60-90 minutes each, on separate days, then definitely seek help.
+ Homework is not a test. It's okay to lookup solutions, to discuss with each other, to talk to a TA, to reach out to the instructor etc.


### Problem

``` python
# Given an array of N strings (ASCII characters), of length K each,
# return all groups of strings that are anagrams.
```


1. Ask questions
2. Try and/or write down examples
3. Try brute force solution
4. More optimized solution
5. Can you do better?


### How does grading go?

4. Inspirational
    + Matched the belief system of the interview (Qualitative score)
    + Really inspired
3. Good Enough
2. You tried well, but it wasn't good enough
    + Without edge cases
2. You tried
1. Really?


### About Progress
1. This is a marathon, not a sprint
2. More problems you do the proper way, the better you will get. That's the only way to keep improving
3. Progress is a step function, not a linear function.

### Learning vs Performing
1. You're in the course to Learn, **not** to Perform.
2. Use the course as your failure ground. Fail here, instead of wasting a year or more.
3. We'll be grading you, but nobody is judging you.

### About Practice
1. Practice always works, if you trust that it'll kick in.
2. **Practice doesn't always work, if you are looking for exact recipes.**

### Your goal is NOT to
1. Memorize problems without understanding
2. Become an expert at interviewing (10000 hours)
3. "Beat" the system. That'll never work.
    4. We are aligning with the system. The system expects you to practice

### Your goals are:
+ In immediate term:
    + Memorize the problems, with full understanding
    + We'll go through a book's worth of volume
+ In Medium Term:
    + Keep practice everyday

### When am I ready?
+ Obviously no concrete answer, but here are some signs
    + You have done nearly all homework and tests
    + Variation in scores in mock interviews is reducing, as you do more of them
    + You're getting more comfortable with your practice companies
    + You start to get a sense that most problems revolve around CS fundamentals you already have
