## Converting Base Ten Numbers to Binary

Start with a number 3,467 in the base ten world.
7 is in the ones place.
6 is in the tens place and represents 6 10's.
4 is in the hundreds place and represents 4 100's.
3 is in the thousands place.

```
3000 + 400 + 60 + 7
```

Base ten numbering system uses digits 0-9.
We call the number ten, 0 units and 1 ten.


In a binary system, we only use digits 0 and 1.


## Example
Convert 47 in base ten which represents 7 ones and 4 tens.


We can create a binary table:


2^6 | 2^5 | 2^4 | 2^3 | 2^2 | 2^1 | unit


128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | unit


If we take the number 47, we say there is one in the 32nd place, 1 in the 8th place, 1 in the 4th place, 1 in the 2nd place, and 1 in the units place to sum to 47.

## Example 2

Convert 54 in base ten to binary.


If we take the 54, we say there is one in the 32nd place, 1 in the 16th place, 1 in the 4th place, and 1 in the 2nd place which all sum to 54.
