# GCD and LCM

## Problem 1

Find the GCD and LCM of 6 and 21, 12 and 20.

## Solution

Break down each number into their prime factorizations.
3 is the common factor of 6 and 21 and it is the lowest common multiple.


To find the LCM, multiply the prime factors of both integers.
2 * 3 * 7 = 42


Break down 12.
4 * 3
2 * 2  3


Break down 20.
4 * 5
2 * 2  5


12 and 20 have two 2's in common.
So the GCD of 12 and 20 is 2^2.


The LCM of 12 and 20 is the multiplication of all unique prime factors.
3 * 2^2 * 5 = 60
